Designed to be decoded from knowing what A and B is (you still need this to know how to do it though)

Rounded to nearest whole (4 or lower = down / 5 or higher = up)

NEW CHARACTER = /
/ = / (but between new character, "224/365///1752/270/294")
SPACE = 0
A = 24
B = 73
C = Square Root of A²+B² 
D = A+B+C 
E = D-B OR A+C 
F = E/10 
G = F + BD 
H = G/D + A 
I = H-B+E 
J = I-E 
K = I+J 
L = K+G 
M = L-F 
N = Square Root of AxBxC 
O = AxB 
P = O+K 
Q = P+N 
R = B-A 
S = A+B 
T = H+S
U = T-A 
V = Square Root of G 
W = A+H 
X = W-V 
Y = X+A 
Z = C-B
